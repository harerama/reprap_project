My RepRap project

Here starts my (maybe long) journey into the fatastic world of 3D printing

I chose to build a RepRap Prusa Mendel i3 rework:
  - because there is a lot of support on the French usergroup for this model
  - because the Prusa Mendel i3 seems a good start for beginners (easy to build, lots of doc)

For the parts:
  - I will get the printed parts + wood frame and printing plate from some of the forum members (@ 70-80€ total I guess)
  - Hotend will be E3D v6 3mm direct (http://e3d-online.com/E3D-v6/Full-Kit/v6-3mm-Direct @ 43£)
  - I will but the stepper motors from either eBay or aliexpress, for 5 motors the price is around 50€
  - I will probably buy an Arduino Mega + RAMPS 1.4 kit (already assembled) for around 40$ on Aliexpress (I would have loved to build it myself, but I don't think I can match that price)
  - No hotbed (for a start, it will come later)
  - Power supply will probably a repurposed ATX power supply from a computer I don't use
  -
